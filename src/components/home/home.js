The process of beginning therapy and finding a therapist can feel overwhelming and frightening. I understand that and believe that those who are starting this process are truly courageous and resourceful. In my experience, I have found that having a safe, contained and trusting environment to share all of one’s thoughts, feelings and experiences can be restorative and healing.
`;
export const mission = `
My vision is to provide  safe, culturally competent, holistic, and wellness focused services that promote  insight into thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and promote the health and quality of life of our community members. By utilizing a dynamic and holistic approach to therapy, I strive to provide a safe and nonjudgmental space for individuals, couples, and families to work through personal life issues, and flourish into the best versions of themselves.
