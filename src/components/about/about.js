I am a licensed psychotherapist, working for over 11 years with individuals, couples, and families. I completed a Master’s degree in Women’s & Gender Studies at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro  and focused on improving access to health care as well as reducing health disparities amongst women, people of color, and the GLBTQ population.
After working in public health education, I furthered my knowledge by bridging physical health and mental health by studying psychology. 

I am a graduate of New York University (NYU), I completed my advanced psychodynamic and Horneian training at the American Institute for Psychoanalysis. In addition to psychodynamic techniques, I have found relational concepts and Cognitive Behavioral techniques, in combination with multicultural, holistic, spiritual, and strength based tools help to bring about the most significant growth and change.


I am a New York native and in addition to being a psychotherapist I am a committed activist for social-justice in our community. I am a hospital director and community advocate working with the homeless population diagnosed with severe and persistent mental illness, as well as, HIV/AIDs who struggle to maintain stable housing `;
