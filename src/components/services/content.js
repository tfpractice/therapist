  We all bring with us diverse perspectives, lived experiences, life styles, work history,  and cultures to the workforce. The transforming demographics and economics of our flourishing multicultural world has challenged academic institutions, nonprofit & corporate agencies and government organizations to consider cultural diversity, and staff & client inclusion as a priority. 

  - Diversity is defined as the differences between people.
  - Multiculturalism is deeper than diversity, by focusing on understanding, inclusiveness, respect and looking at the unequal power in society. 
  - Inclusion is a state of being valued, respected and supported. It’s about focusing on the needs of every individual and ensuring the right conditions are in place for each person to achieve his or her full potential.

When we draw on the knowledge of a workforce that reflects the population we serve, we are better able to understand and meet the needs of our consumers. In broad terms a culturally diverse workplace has a respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, education, and religion; an understanding of one’s own beliefs and biases. Inclusion should be reflected in an organization’s culture, practices, and physical structure to support a diverse workforce.
  
A reliable body of research indicates a lack of culturally competent care directly contributes to poor client outcomes, reduced client compliance, and increased attrition, regardless of the quality of services and systems available. In addition to improving care quality, delivering culturally competent care increases job satisfaction and contributes to staff retention.
  
In essence, the successful training and development of a multicultural workforce is necessary to be competitive in our internationally growing economy. It is critical organizations provide diversity training to their managers and employees to create a workforce development that is culturally aware and adaptable.

## Spirituality
Nearly 80 percent of Americans say they practice some type of religion according to a 2012 Pew Research Center study. Whether a person is religious, spiritual or neither, religion has a major influence on culture and widely shapes how we see the world and process ourselves and our existence. 

There is a substantial body of experience that supports the use of spirituality and religion in relation to one’s mental health from day to day purpose, decreasing symptoms of illness, and support and opposition to isolation. Many people who incorporate faith and spirituality into daily practice reported feeling more productive, feeling more engaged in community activities, and having a higher quality of life than those who reported a loss of faith in the same year.

Incorporating spirituality in therapy can be very beneficial particularly when dealing with major life stressors such as trauma, natural disaster, and illness, loss of loved ones, divorce and serious mental illness. Many studies and personal practice show that religion and spirituality are generally helpful to people in coping, especially people with the fewest resources facing the most uncontrollable of problems. Along with other therapeutic modalities together we can develop coping methods include spiritual support, practices to facilitate life transitions, spiritual forgiveness, support from a religious institution or ministry, and reframing a stressful situation into a compassionate structure of meaning.

export const churchHurt = `## Church Hurt 
Church Hurt is a term which refers to the pain or trauma sometimes inflicted by religious institutions; this pain could come from a variety of sources but ultimately the pain that d## instances the one who suffered from their church, communities, and from God.  Often the hurt and harm of spiritual abuse has no intention to wound anyone yet deeply impacts its audience. As a therapist I often find people who have been deeply injured by the family of God, leaving them confused and expended. 

As a therapist, I often see leaders who are in conflict within the body of believers; this may be due to lifestyle, sexuality, marital status/divorce, or many other life choices.  Clients have expressed they were upset by a pastor who demonized them for their behavior, their family situation or being GLBTQ. I’ve heard stories from clients who have found church confusing, contradictory, or even damaging to their identity and self-image. This church hurt reality can leave people isolated, disconnected, reluctant to re-engage, afraid of being hurt again. Many clients enter therapy conflicted about their spirituality as a result of church hurt or ambivalent about wanting to return to church, finding a new place of worship, and questioning the place of church in their lives.
 
While churches and other places of worship should be a shelter offering protection, a safe house for the broken, a rescue for the abused and mistreated, sadly, some of the most serious and enduring pain is inflicted by the church, by people in these churches.  Individual therapy, group therapy, or church workshops are always to process church hurt and provide a safe space to build a safe and thriving relationship with spirituality and maintain church retention. `;
